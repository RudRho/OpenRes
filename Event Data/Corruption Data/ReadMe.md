This folder contains all of the Corruption datasets for the OpenRes event.

* __TI-corruption-perception-index.csv__: 
This dataset gives the Corruption Perception Index for countries from 2012 to 2015. Corruption Perception Index scores countries on a scale of 0-100, where 0 means that a country is perceived as highly corrupt and 100 means that a country is perceived as very clean. The indicator is representative of expert opinion, as it is constructed by taking the averages of various standardized expert surveys, including those from the Bertelsmann Foundation, the World Economic Forum, the World Bank, and many others.  
* __average-rating-of-corruption-perception.csv__:
This dataset comes from Transparency International who survey individuals around the world, asking them about their opinions and experiences regarding corruption. This data provides the average national perception of corruption, as rated on a scale of 1 to 5 by respondents asked the question: “To what extent do you think that corruption is a problem in the public sector in this country?”. The data is from 2013.
* __share-of-people-who-think-political-parties-are-very-corrupt.csv__:
This dataset comes from Transparency International as well. It shows the percentage of survey respondents in each country who think that political parties are “corrupt or extremely corrupt”.
* __share-of-people-paying-bribes-2013.csv__:
This dataset again comes from Transparency International. Bribery is one of the most common forms of corruption. The data shows the share of people who report having paid a bribe to access public services in the 12 months prior to the survey. The data comes from the Global Corruption Barometer. The public services in question are: education, judiciary, medical and health, police, registry and permit services, utilities, tax revenue and/or customs, and land services.
* __incidence-bribes-firms-2013.csv__:
This data shows, for a selection of countries, the percentage of firms experiencing at least one bribe payment request during 6 transactions dealing with utilities access, permits, licenses, and taxes. The data comes from the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys (2007-2013).
* __human-development-index-vs-corruption-perception-index.csv__:
This dataset contains information on the corruption index (same as above), the Human Development Index (HDI) and total population each year from 1800. (Note that there are many missing data points in this dataset as there is often no data for the earlier years). The HDI is a composite statistic (index) that measures key dimensions of human development:
  * a long and healthy life (uses data on life expectancy)
  * being knowledgeable (uses data on literacy and education)
  * and have a decent standard of living (uses data on GDP)
