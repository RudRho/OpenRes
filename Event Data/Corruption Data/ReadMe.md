This folder contains all of the Corruption datasets for the OpenRes event.

* __TI-corruption-perception-index.csv__: 
This dataset gives the Corruption Perception Index for countries from 2012 to 2015. Corruption Perception Index scores countries on a scale of 0-100, where 0 means that a country is perceived as highly corrupt and 100 means that a country is perceived as very clean. The indicator is representative of expert opinion, as it is constructed by taking the averages of various standardized expert surveys, including those from the Bertelsmann Foundation, the World Economic Forum, the World Bank, and many others.  
* __average-rating-of-corruption-perception.csv__:
This dataset comes from Transparency International who survey individuals around the world, asking them about their opinions and experiences regarding corruption. This data provides the average national perception of corruption, as rated on a scale of 1 to 5 by respondents asked the question: “To what extent do you think that corruption is a problem in the public sector in this country?”. The data is from 2013.
* __share-of-people-who-think-political-parties-are-very-corrupt.csv__:
This dataset comes from Transparency International as well. It shows the percentage of survey respondents in each country who think that political parties are “corrupt or extremely corrupt”.
* __share-of-people-paying-bribes-2013.csv__:
This dataset again comes from Transparency International. Bribery is one of the most common forms of corruption.
